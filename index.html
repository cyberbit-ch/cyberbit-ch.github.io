      <p>Hello, nice to meet you, I am Claire, your nerdy escort! My favorite kind of person is a bit geeky, has an
        unusual interest in something outside of the norm, and is curious and eager to explore things. Many times I felt
        that the shy people turned out to be the most interesting to spend time with, but you have to get to know them a
        bit before they allow you to see this side. I can easily get into deep conversations with most people. And
        that's also what I enjoy the most about the connection that intimate touch creates. I love the conversation that
        becomes possible after a physical connection.</p>
      <p>You would like to spend a relaxed evening programming together in charming company? You would like to spend a
        weekend skiing, snowboarding, climbing, hiking in the mountains and cuddle up or relax in a spa together
        afterwards? Or do you want to have somebody to travel with? You lack sexual experience and want to build it up
        before entering into the dating game? Then search no more! Or maybe you want to try out a kink which only exists
        in your fantasy until now? Let's see together whether this can be done! </p>
      <p>While you are here, did you already check out my new photo album?<br>

          <p>I love spending time in the mountains with an easy going person, be it snowboarding or ski touring or
            climbing, with a nice spa to warm up after exhausting time in the snow. I also like spending a cultural
            evening with a nice dinner, or some time cuddled up in bed watching a movie.</p>
          <p>Even though Switzerland always marvels me with its picturesque mountains and blue lakes, I also love
            exploring different countries and cultures, different food and activities like diving, wind surfing, or
            walking around in the ruins of an ancient civilization and learning about the past. One reason for me to
            learn so many languages is to connect with people when traveling. Some of the most memorable memories from my
            travels are staying with an aboriginal tribe in the mountains in Thailand, far away from civilization,
            diving with sting rays in Vietnam, climbing a 6000er mountain in Bolivia and hitchhiking in Iceland. How
            awesome is it to come back after such an adventure to a cozy hotel room and cuddle up?</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Special preferences</h2>
          <p>❤ <b>Code and Chill:</b> Spend a nice quiet evening on the computer learning Rust or coding in C,
            interrupted by a few intimate moments. Who says informatics can’t be a foreplay?</p>
          <p>❤ <b>Sports and Chill:</b> Spend a day in the outdoors doing the sports you love, skiing or bouldering, and
            let the day end with a relaxing and sensual session at the spa. Or let's just do a workout naked together in
            the morning after the first coffee of the day ;)</p>
          <p>❤ <b>Travel and Chill:</b> Spend a day discovering the hidden off the beaten paths of Rome, the food in
            France, the beaches in Spain or the castles of Germany. Let me be your guide in one of the six languages I
            speak.</p>
          <p>But why should I limit your idea of how a date could go? Write me your idea of a perfect date and I will
            see what I can do to make it become reality :)</p>

      <h2>Who can book me?</h2>
        <p>As a person who does not completely fit into society, I get along especially well with people that also do
          not pass the bar to being normal. I love talking to people that are smart, think different or have interests
          outside of the norm. Because normal is boring!</p>
        <p>Often times, the geeky and shy people turn out to be the most interesting to spend time with. It is easy for
          me to get a deeper connection with people. I like spending time with people, getting into deep conversations
          and listening to their stories. There are so many interesting people out there, and a lifetime is just not
          enough to meet all of them.</p>
        <p>So no matter who you are, whether you like intimate cuddles or intense erotic, whether you are a virgin or a
          couple, we can have an enjoyable time together.</p>
        <h2>You are an engineer, why do you escort?</h2>
                <p>I love my job, but I also love to escape this world from time to time and see life from a different person's
          perspective. Furthermore, this job makes it possible for me to explore my own sexuality, try out different
          kinks of other people and see how I feel about it. Sometimes people surprise me with a visit to a nice
          restaurant, other times we might do sports. No date is alike! I am curious to find out how your ideal date
          looks like!</p>
